# Face-Recognition-using-PCA-2d-PCA-k-PCA-


This Python-based project applies advanced face recognition techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Two-Dimensional PCA (2D-PCA), and Kernel PCA (K-PCA). It focuses on efficiently recognizing faces by reducing dimensionality, directly processing image matrices, and handling non-linear data transformations. The implementation combines Pythonâ€™s computational capabilities with powerful libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and OpenCV, offering a robust solution for accurate face recognition. This project is suitable for those interested in image processing, machine learning, and practical applications of facial recognition technologies.

## STEPS IN FACE RECOGNITION

1) Format the Image Matrix
2) Find mean vector and mean- subtracted image matrix
3) Compute Eigenvectora and Eigenvalues from the covariance matrix
4) Choose Eigenfaces
5) Find the weight matrix
6) Recognise the face
